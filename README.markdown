# Gemstone's TEAM Diet RoR webapp repository

This is where development of our tool will take place. Special thanks goes to the
sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/) for its awesomeness. We're using it as a basis for our app and will hopefully be making more and more changes as we go on. Basically, we owe this man [*many, many beers*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware).
